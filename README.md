=============

##Concept

A sidescroller version of a game similar to Temple-Run.
The name is a working title. Created initially for a Game Design 2 class, we named it tRON because of a fascination with the simplistic laser graphics of Tron, as well as the fact our great teacher's name was Ron. For the sake of a Beta version of the game we decided to call it tRON.

##Style of Play

- The character is always moving forward.
- There is an enemy always following you.
- Obstacles can slow you down if you do not jump right.
- If the Enemy catches you, you will die.
- There are flame piles that you must jump over to survive.
- The goal is to collect as many coins as you can.
- When you collect coins in a row within a certain amount of time, your point bonus per coin goes up.
- Levels get generated automatically and get more flame pits and obstacles as the levels get harder.
